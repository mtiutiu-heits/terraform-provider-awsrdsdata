# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Provider

The **AWSRDSDATA** provider provides utilities for working with users and privileges on MySQL clusters (Aurora V1) 
via the [RDS data service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html).
It provides resources that allow MySQL users and privileges to be created as part of a Terraform deployment.

**Important Note:**

Make sure to **enable the HTTP endpoint** for the RDS data service (e.g. set **`enable_http_endpoint`** to **`true`** for the **`aws_rds_cluster`** resource).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.
